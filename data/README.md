# APC Data

This folder contains the literature data for the aperiodic-clinical project.

Overview:
- `apc_readme.txt` is a description file with information on the data
- `apc_data.numbers` is an Numbers spreadsheet file containing the full literature dataset and a summary sheet
- `apc_data.csv` is a csv file containing the full set of data as in the numbers file (but no summary sheet)
- `apc_data_table.pdf` is a copy of the dataset in table form, the same as Table 2 in the manuscript
    Note that the table is a subset of information in the full dataset, and has minor formatting differences
